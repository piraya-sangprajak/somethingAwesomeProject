# COMP6441 somethingAwesomeProject

This is my project for UNSW COMP6441 Something Awesome Project where I develop tooling (red teaming). I decided I'd try to learn how to create a keylogger hidden within an infected website's software as a way to better understand COMP6441's concepts and the ethical dangers keylogging tools have. My website is a simple Notes/Diary website which allows users to share their personal thoughts and opinions under the false safety of an authentication. The keylogger is embedded into the website's backend and will automatically run when the user visits the website's login, sign-up and home page. 

Since I have never coded in Python, Flask or HTML before, I used this youtube video as a guidance for my website code: https://youtu.be/dam0GPOAvVI?si=yYUr1Rzixh-hdMpJ
